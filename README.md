# BattleSpace
The 2015 API 3D Space BattleShip Game, currently this 'game' is under heavy development.

##Development
I started using the circe library, however I switched to using the [[argonaut]] library
since I could control the de/serialization libraries a little better. Currently all the
routes work however the initial game state is still in some flux while I work out the
details.
